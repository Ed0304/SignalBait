        question: "What languages does SignalBait support?",

        question: "Can SignalBait guarantee that a message is safe?",

        question: "Does SignalBait store the messages I submit?",
        answer: "SignalBait does not retain submitted messages or URLs after analysis. However, please do not enter passwords, authentication codes, financial information, or other sensitive data when using this service."

    {
        question: "How does AI work in SignalBait?",
        answer: "SignalBait uses AI to analyze aspects of a message such as sentiment, urgency, grammar, and spelling inconsistencies. The AI helps explain these patterns and how they may relate to common social-engineering techniques."
    },
    {
        question: "Does SignalBait automatically know whether a message is a scam?",
        answer: "SignalBait does not rely on AI alone to determine whether a message is suspicious. Its analysis uses identifiable security indicators, while AI is used to help explain the findings."
    },
    {
        question: "I recently got scammed. Can this application help me to recover my money?",
        answer:"No. SignalBait is designed to help users analyze suspicious messages and links before they act on them. If you have already been affected by a scam, contact your local authorities and/or relevant financial institution as soon as possible."
